# LibreBounce
A [libre software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), mixin-based cheat client for the [Ornithe Mod Loader](https://ornithemc.net), for Minecraft 1.8.9; it's a fork of [LiquidBounce Legacy](https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce/tree/legacy), aiming to compete with paid & non-libre hacked clients.

If anyone would like to contact me through Discord, my username is `thatonecoder_`. More contact methods may be found through my [Codeberg profile page](https://codeberg.org/thatonecoder), although I cannot guarantee any attempts will be successful.

Divergences from LiquidBounce Legacy are listed in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md); note that there are also many refactors, making the code much cleaner.

## Contributing
We highly appreciate contributions. If you would like to support us, feel free to make changes to LibreBounce's source code and submit a pull request. Currently, our main goals are the following, by order of priority:

1. Make rotation patterns that bypass advanced anti-cheats (such as Polar),
2. Fix a bug where rotation modules still affect the player after being turned off.
3Add full backwards-compatibility with historical LiquidBounce versions (b68, b72).

Any additional goals are easily found by code searching "TO-DO", and are equally as important, if not more.
If you have experience in one or more of these fields, we would highly appreciate your support.
